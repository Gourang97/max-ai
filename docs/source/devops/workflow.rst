Workflow
========

Max.AI platform supports Automated devops powered by GitOps which helps developers to deploy their code at ease/simple clicks. Typical Build + deploment flow is shown in the below picture, where the developer writes/develops code on the notebooks (a service that is enabled via max) and commit their code to git of their choice (GitHub, azure repos or GitLab etc.).

Let see how all the above steps can be configured on the max platform in detail:
    1.	**Configure GitOps**: Max.AI uses GitOps to pull Kubernetes configuration files of the applications. For storing the configuration files and desired state of the applications, Git credentials must be provided at Global Configurations > GitOps within the Application dashboard. The available git providers are:
    
        - GitHub
        - Bitbucket
        - Gitlab
        - Azure

    2. **Configure Container registry**: User can configure a container registry either a public or private using any registry provider of choice. It allows the user to build, deploy, and manage your container images or charts with an easy-to-use UI.

    3. **Create an application**: user can create an application on the platform with the code they have on git. This will include the workflow steps of CI/CD configuration as well.
    
        - Click on create new and choose custom app

        - **Configure CI**: Build configuration is used to create and push docker images in the container registry of your application. You will provide all the docker related information to build and push docker images on the Build Configuration page.
