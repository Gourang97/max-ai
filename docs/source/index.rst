Welcome to Max.AI's documentation!
==================================
Max.AI provides a ready list of utilities to create end-to-end Machine Learning pipelines and solve complex business problems using state-of-the-art modules. 

Built entirely on PySpark, Max.AI comes with modules that can help in processing and transformation of data, performing feature engineering and selection and a host of Machine Learning Models like Classification, Clustering, Regression and Time-Series. All these modules have built-in logging enabled, which can be viewed on the MLFlow Dashboard (if experiment and runs are initialized).
